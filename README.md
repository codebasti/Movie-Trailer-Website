# Movie Trailer Website -
#### _by Sebastian PÃ¼tz_
This project contains a server side programm, that puts out a website to show my personal, favorite movies, aswell as their poster and Trailer. It was made within Udacity's Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree.


## Installation
1. Install python v. 2.7 or later (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the repository via git or zip-file (https://github.com/codebasti/Movie-Trailer-Website/)
3. Open your command line interface (cmd on windows) and navigate to the folder you downloaded.
4. Type the following command
```bash
python entertainment_center.py
```
5. Press Enter

Now your standard browser should open and you should see my movie trailer website.


## Usage
If you click on one of the movie posters, the server should load its trailer in a new window.
The trailers are just linked youtube-videos.
The poster are linked pictures, located at wikipedia.
